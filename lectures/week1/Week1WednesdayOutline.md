- After main lecture:
    - Bonus activity where we put everything together in this challenge: Given a list of integers as input, each of which is 0 to 100, inclusively, return a new list, where each item is one of the following strings:
        - "Congratulations on earning a score of < score goes here >!" when the number is 90 or more.  For example, "Congratulations on earning a score of 95!"
        - "You did well with a score of < score here >!" when the number is 80-89, inclusively.
        - "You did fine with a score of < score here >!" when the number is 70-79, inclusively.
        - "It's okay!  You'll do better next time!" when the number is less than 70.
    - For example, if you got [85, 92, 73], you'll return:
        - ["You did well with a score of 85!", "Congratulations on earning a score of 92!", "You did fine with a score of 73!"]
